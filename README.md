# SmartWaste Monitoring System Mobile Application

An IoT-based Android mobile application developed as a Final Year Project to monitor garbage bin fill levels in real time and improve waste collection efficiency.  
The system integrates hardware sensors with a mobile dashboard to reduce overflowing bins and optimize waste collection schedules.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project addresses common waste management issues such as overflowing garbage bins and inconsistent collection times, especially in high-traffic areas like university campuses.

The system uses an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a dustbin to measure waste levels. The data is sent through a NodeMCU (ESP8266) module to a cloud platform, where it can be monitored via a mobile application. When the bin reaches a certain fill level, notifications can be triggered to alert waste management personnel.
